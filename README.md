FIRE Calculator
===============
This small Python CLI takes in several variables, and predicts how many years until you can FIRE. It accounts for inflation, different monetary needs at different points in time (e.g. you probably don't need as much money when you're 80 as when you're 40), etc.

To use, pass the `-h` flag and fill in the required positional args.
